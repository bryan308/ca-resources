## Steps to Gather Resource Information

<Steps>

<Step>

### Gather Title

Using developer tools, inspect the website’s `<title>` element inside the `<head>` tag and copy the text to use as the resource title.

<ImageSection 
  src="/contribution-images/gather-title.png"
  alt="gather title"
  width={580}
  height={333} 
  subtitle="gather title"
/>

</Step>

<Step>

### Get the URL

Copy the main website URL. If the webpage is a subpage, it's acceptable to use it as long as it directs users to the main webpage where the resource is located.

</Step>

<Step>

### Get the Description

Look for the `<meta name="description" content="...">` tag in the `<head>` section. Copy the `content` attribute's value as the description.

<ImageSection 
  src="/contribution-images/gather-description.png"
  alt="gather description"
  width={576}
  height={334}
  subtitle="gather description"
/>

If it's not available, you can use AI to describe the website.

</Step>

<Step>

### Find the Icon

Use `favicon.ico` if there are no icons available, but try to find a high-resolution icons first. If multiple icons are available, choose one that is similar to the favicon used. 

Some websites may not have an icon; if that’s the case, don’t use the icon attribute. Store icons in the relevant folder inside `/public/resources/`.

<Files>
<Folder name="public" defaultOpen>

<Folder name="resources" defaultOpen>

<Folder name="colors">
  <File name="coolors.png" />
</Folder>

<Folder name="icons">
  <File name="svgmix.png" />
</Folder>

<Folder name="learnwebdev">
  <File name="mdn.png" />
</Folder>

</Folder>

</Folder>
</Files>

</Step>
