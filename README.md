> **Note:**
> For most contributions, you can simply fork the repo and submit a pull request.
> 
> If you want to build and test the app locally, you will need a GitHub personal access token in a `.env.local` file:
> 
> ```
> GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
> GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=your_github_oauth_token
> ```
> 
> This is optionalâ€”without these tokens, you can still contribute, but you won't be able to run the app locally. Never commit your tokens to the repository.
